Update: [I have quit Roblox as of 11.28.2025, I will be inactive on Roblox from now on.]

I primarily code in **Python** as a hobby and is what called a "small content creator".
However, I'm mostly known for making Roblox videos on YouTube on an okay level. 📷

I have over 480 subscribers on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@ccryxn) and you can call me
ryxn, but you can call me xyr [old nickname]
